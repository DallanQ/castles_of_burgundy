[selling-goods](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1996198/selling-goods)

> When you sell goods of the same colour and turn them over can you put any colour you want on top of them? Or can you not even put any othe goods on a used one?

Yes, you have three spaces for unsold goods and one space for sold goods. So, when you sell goods, you take them off their current space, flip them over and put them on the sold goods space. The space they departed is now empty and “uncolored”.

[are-workers-limited-components](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1123757/are-workers-limited-components)

> Are Workers and Silverlings Limited Components?

from the rule book "The supply of worker tiles and Silverlings are not intended to be limited. In the rare case that the supply is exhausted, you can use nuggets of silver for the silverlings, and meeples for the workers."

[yellow-tiles-3-and-4](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/963182/yellow-tiles-3-and-4)

> Can a player benefit from both yellow tile #3 (two silverlings on goods sales) and #4 (worker tile on good sales) on the same goods sale?

Quoted from the rulebook 
"3) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 Silverlings from the general supply instead of 1 each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate)."
and
"4) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the general supply in addition to the usual Silverling each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate)."

Of course you can have both effects if you have these on your estate.
But, keep in mind though, effects do not stack. Having these two tiles gives you benefits when selling goods. Those benefits aside from the normal selling benefit are 2 silverlings and 1 worker tile. Note that you don't add the two to become 3 silverlings and 1 worker.

[knowledge-tile-6](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1327419/knowledge-tile-6)

> I know that you can only buy once per turn from the black market, but what if you already placed down the yellow knowledge tile #6, can you use your silver multiple times to buy from the 6 numbered depots? For instance I got 6 silver, and on my turn I use 2 silverlings to buy 1 tile from the black market, and through my #6 knowledge tile I will buy 2 more tiles with my last 4 silver from the numbered depots?

No. From the essential rule book (you can find this from the file section), players "may buy tiles from all seven depots (still only one purchase per turn)" The knowledge tile simply expands of your choice not the number of purchases.

> The rules say you have to build your next building adjacent to those you've already built. Do Castles have different rules? Can I place a Castle anywhere in my estate so long as it is dark green even if it is not touching a building that I've built so far?

Castles are a dark green tile, and therefore have to be placed only on a dark green hex on your estate.
There are no exceptions with the hexagonal tiles. Each one has to be placed on a tile with a matching color, using a die with a matching number, and has to be adjacent to an already-placed tile.

[scoring-the-phases](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1292124/scoring-the-phases)

> I saw on the rule book that a player gets points by ending a region, and he gets the number of points acording to his size. So, for example, for a tile size region-one point for a five tile region-15 points and aditionally number of points acording to the phase A,B,C and so on, my question is that if I finish a one tile region in the A phase I get 11 Victory points?

Yes. Score small regions early. Bigger regions will take longer, so you're better off only finishing those after you've gotten the bonuses for scoring your smaller regions quickly.

[actions-rule](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2502319/actions-rule)

> In Castles of Burgandy, when it's your turn you have 4 options with your dice. Can you use an option twice in your turn? For example can I buy twice or build twice? Or can I only use one action once in my turn ?

Yes. According to the rule book, "A die is required for each action. The two actions per turn may be carried out in any combination and order (including carrying the same action out twice)."

[alternate-boards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1432163/alternate-boards)

> When using alternate boards, the starting tiles is always the one in the middle, isn't it?
Even if it isn't a castle? In that case (i.e. a brown tile), do you simply extract one random tile and place it on your board?

No. Each player is given a start castle tile (the dark green one). If you look at the back of the rules book, there is a section confirming that players can place this start castle on any of the four valid castle spots at the start of the game, rather than on the middle spot on board #1.

> Do you take points for completing the starting castle area, if it is a 1-space area? This wouldn't matter if everybody has one, but some boards have larger castle areas.

The first castle is placed as part of set-up and does not occur as part of the game, thus no bonus points.

[goods-tiles-at-the-end-of-the-phase](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1517979/goods-tiles-at-the-end-of-the-phase)

> After each phase do the goods tiles get removed from the main board or just the 6-sided tiles?

No, the good tiles are not removed, it's just the 6-sided tiles. 
The goods tiles stay put until they're claimed through a shipping action.

[setup-worker-distribution-clockwise-direction](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1731583/setup-worker-distribution-clockwise-direction)

> The rules state that: "[The start player] receives 1 worker tile ... The next player in clockwise direction receives 2 worker chips (I assume "chips" is supposed to say "tiles"), the third player receives 3 and the fourth player receives 4."
> But the bold summary text in the right-hand column says: "...give each player 1 to 4 worker tiles depending on play order."
>Which one is it?

The 1st player gets 1 worker tile,the 2nd gets 2, the 3rd gets 3, and the 4th gets 4.
Also turn order is determined in a clockwise order when the game begins.

[plaing-a-knowledge-tile](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/824415/plaing-a-knowledge-tile)

> Where do I place knowledge tiles on my player board when I acquire them?

When you take the knowledge tiles from the depot, you put them in the staging area (or whatever that's called) just like the other tiles. Then you put them on your estate, onto the yellow hexes, just like the other ones.

[castle-extra-action-to-pay-for-a-central-black-dep](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1187285/castle-extra-action-to-pay-for-a-central-black-dep)

> Can you use your extra action when you add a castle to your estate to pay two silverlings and take any tile from the Black Depot?

Here are the relevant rules from the book...
1. Castle (dark green): Whenever a player adds a castle tile to his estate (which
can occur up to 3 times), then he immediately carries out an additional action
of his choice.

3. The central black depot: In addition to his two dice actions, each player may, once per turn, choose to
buy one of the six-sided tiles from the central black depot. He may do this at any
point during his turn: before, between or after the dice actions.
To accomplish this, the player must return 2 Silverlings to the general
supply and subsequently place the newly-purchased six-sided tile, as
with any tile from the game board, onto an empty storage space in
the lower left-hand corner of his board.

> Does the knowledge tile #2 provide worker tiles at the end of the final phase which is also the end of the game?

Yes, workers are produced under knowledge tile #2 during the final phase, because the final phase is just a phase. You do all the same things you do in the other 4 phases.

[rules-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1700617/rules-questions)

> Does worker disbursement only occur at the beginning of the game once, every roll, or start of each phase?

Worker disbursement only occurs at the start of the game.

[shipped-goods-scoring](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1735343/shipped-goods-scoring)

> The rules state that we score 1 point for each unsold good. What about goods that have been sold during the game?

No, they don't score anything at the end of the game. When goods were sold, they should have each scored 2-4 points per tile depending on the number of players.

> Can I spent a die to get the goods from a corresponding goods space (without the shipment tile being played)

No -- you may only use a ship. There isn't even a brown tile that lets you take goods.

> Where can I find the meaning of the symbols on the goods spaces?

Those just mean: "When you play a ship, take the goods from a space".

> I've tried looking everywhere in the rules but can't find how to calculate points when selling goods. It said they are variable points according to player count... How do I go about it?

Each sold good gives as many points as the number of players.
So, 2 goods in a 2 player game gives a total of 4 points.

Yes, you still start with one castle "already" on the board. 
The advanced rules on the back page of the rulebook outline the folllowing steps:
- determine player order
- each player receives a random board
- players choose which side to play
- players choose which dark green space to place their starting castle on

> In solo mode, if I have rolled a 6, can I use a worker tile to adjust the value to 5 and then place a ship on a blue "5" space on my player board?

Yes. You can adjust your color-rolled dice from a 6 to a 5 or to a 1 using one worker tile. You can even adjust it to a 4 or a 2 using two worker tiles or even to any number using 3 worker tiles. The adjusted dice-roll can then be used for any action, like placing an hex-tile on your estate (from your hex-tiles storage space, not directly from the game board).

In a round after each player has used both of their dice, the only thing that happens next is the (possibly new) first player rolls the white die to put out another good for ships to collect and players re-roll their dice for the new round. Those goods tiles disappearing from round to round (after five were laid out at the beginning of the phase) are what let you know where you're at and when you're headed to the next phase.
