[selling-goods](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1996198/selling-goods)

> When you sell goods of the same colour and turn them over can you put any colour you want on top of them? Or can you not even put any othe goods on a used one?

Yes, you have three spaces for unsold goods and one space for sold goods. So, when you sell goods, you take them off their current space, flip them over and put them on the sold goods space. The space they departed is now empty and “uncolored”.

[are-workers-limited-components](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1123757/are-workers-limited-components)

> Are Workers and Silverlings Limited Components?

from the rule book "The supply of worker tiles and Silverlings are not intended to be limited. In the rare case that the supply is exhausted, you can use nuggets of silver for the silverlings, and meeples for the workers."

[yellow-tiles-3-and-4](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/963182/yellow-tiles-3-and-4)

> Can a player benefit from both yellow tile #3 (two silverlings on goods sales) and #4 (worker tile on good sales) on the same goods sale?

Quoted from the rulebook 
"3) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 Silverlings from the general supply instead of 1 each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate)."
and
"4) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the general supply in addition to the usual Silverling each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate)."

Of course you can have both effects if you have these on your estate.
But, keep in mind though, effects do not stack. Having these two tiles gives you benefits when selling goods. Those benefits aside from the normal selling benefit are 2 silverlings and 1 worker tile. Note that you don't add the two to become 3 silverlings and 1 worker.

[knowledge-tile-6](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1327419/knowledge-tile-6)

> I know that you can only buy once per turn from the black market, but what if you already placed down the yellow knowledge tile #6, can you use your silver multiple times to buy from the 6 numbered depots? For instance I got 6 silver, and on my turn I use 2 silverlings to buy 1 tile from the black market, and through my #6 knowledge tile I will buy 2 more tiles with my last 4 silver from the numbered depots?

No. From the essential rule book (you can find this from the file section), players "may buy tiles from all seven depots (still only one purchase per turn)" The knowledge tile simply expands of your choice not the number of purchases.

> The rules say you have to build your next building adjacent to those you've already built. Do Castles have different rules? Can I place a Castle anywhere in my estate so long as it is dark green even if it is not touching a building that I've built so far?

Castles are a dark green tile, and therefore have to be placed only on a dark green hex on your estate.
There are no exceptions with the hexagonal tiles. Each one has to be placed on a tile with a matching color, using a die with a matching number, and has to be adjacent to an already-placed tile.

[scoring-the-phases](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1292124/scoring-the-phases)

> I saw on the rule book that a player gets points by ending a region, and he gets the number of points acording to his size. So, for example, for a tile size region-one point for a five tile region-15 points and aditionally number of points acording to the phase A,B,C and so on, my question is that if I finish a one tile region in the A phase I get 11 Victory points?

Yes. Score small regions early. Bigger regions will take longer, so you're better off only finishing those after you've gotten the bonuses for scoring your smaller regions quickly.

[actions-rule](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2502319/actions-rule)

> In Castles of Burgandy, when it's your turn you have 4 options with your dice. Can you use an option twice in your turn? For example can I buy twice or build twice? Or can I only use one action once in my turn ?

Yes. According to the rule book, "A die is required for each action. The two actions per turn may be carried out in any combination and order (including carrying the same action out twice)."

[alternate-boards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1432163/alternate-boards)

> When using alternate boards, the starting tiles is always the one in the middle, isn't it?
Even if it isn't a castle? In that case (i.e. a brown tile), do you simply extract one random tile and place it on your board?

No. Each player is given a start castle tile (the dark green one). If you look at the back of the rules book, there is a section confirming that players can place this start castle on any of the four valid castle spots at the start of the game, rather than on the middle spot on board #1.

The 1st player gets 1 worker tile,the 2nd gets 2, the 3rd gets 3, and the 4th gets 4.
Also turn order is determined in a clockwise order when the game begins.

[plaing-a-knowledge-tile](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/824415/plaing-a-knowledge-tile)

> Where do I place knowledge tiles on my player board when I acquire them?

When you take the knowledge tiles from the depot, you put them in the staging area (or whatever that's called) just like the other tiles. Then you put them on your estate, onto the yellow hexes, just like the other ones.

[castle-extra-action-to-pay-for-a-central-black-dep](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1187285/castle-extra-action-to-pay-for-a-central-black-dep)

> Can you use your extra action when you add a castle to your estate to pay two silverlings and take any tile from the Black Depot?

Here are the relevant rules from the book...
1. Castle (dark green): Whenever a player adds a castle tile to his estate (which
can occur up to 3 times), then he immediately carries out an additional action
of his choice.

3. The central black depot: In addition to his two dice actions, each player may, once per turn, choose to
buy one of the six-sided tiles from the central black depot. He may do this at any
point during his turn: before, between or after the dice actions.
To accomplish this, the player must return 2 Silverlings to the general
supply and subsequently place the newly-purchased six-sided tile, as
with any tile from the game board, onto an empty storage space in
the lower left-hand corner of his board.

Yes, workers are produced under knowledge tile #2 during the final phase, because the final phase is just a phase. You do all the same things you do in the other 4 phases.

No -- you may only use a ship. There isn't even a brown tile that lets you take goods.

Those just mean: "When you play a ship, take the goods from a space".

Each sold good gives as many points as the number of players.
So, 2 goods in a 2 player game gives a total of 4 points.

Yes. You can adjust your color-rolled dice from a 6 to a 5 or to a 1 using one worker tile. You can even adjust it to a 4 or a 2 using two worker tiles or even to any number using 3 worker tiles.

In a round after each player has used both of their dice, the only thing that happens next is the (possibly new) first player rolls the white die to put out another good for ships to collect and players re-roll their dice for the new round. Those goods tiles disappearing from round to round (after five were laid out at the beginning of the phase) are what let you know where you're at and when you're headed to the next phase.

> The second occurance of a rule relating to turn order indicates putting it on the "first" space -- which one would assume is the leftmost. However the next reference talks about order going from right to left, and seems to indicate that the rightmost disk on top of the stack will be the next first player...
> So how about a clear exposition of the turn order and how the disks get moved?

When a player places a ship into their estate, he/she will then take goods from any of the depots and place them in the upper left goods area. THEN he/she will move the token forward ONE SPACE. If that space is already occupied, they will place their marker on the top of this pile or "tower" of tokens. Play will then proceed by reading the turn order FIRST TO LAST on the lane and TOP TO BOTTOM on stacks.

Therefore if you have three players Red, Green and Black, where Black is on the fourth space and red is stacked on top of green on the second space, the play would proceed thusly: Black, Red, Green.

> Taking a hex you can’t place in duchy to block other players: Is this legal?

Yes, you can take a tile you cannot place. This has most impact in 2 player games, where point opponent lost is a point you gained.

> If someone is second player and they place a Boat tile, they move up one space. I believe this means that they share the same spot as the first player. If/when this occurs, who is the first player?

If the second player moved up one space and shares the space with the person in front of them, they place their marker on top of the first player's marker. The marker on top is now the starting player, and pass the white die.

> (f you use a die to pull a tile off the main board and you have open spots in your holding area, can you immediately put it on your estate?

Yes, you can. But taking a die off the main board and placing it in your estate are two separate actions and would require two dice.

> Can you buy worker tiles with one die and immediately use them on the next or are they only helpful on your next turn?

Yes of course. Same as above - these are two actions that needs both of your dice.

> Could anyone tell me whats with the 3 castle space on the main board near the 6 depot? It has ABCDE on either side of it and in different colors.

Bottom of page three (3) of the rulebook says, "In the three-player game only, there is an exception for the dark green space in the No. 6 depot: In phases A, C and E a castle is placed onto it as normal, but in phases B and D a mine (grey) is placed there instead!"

> I saw green letters, A C E, and white letters B D on a green hexogan on the game board. I guess these letters imply some tile placing rule for 3-people play but have no ideas. What does it mean?

It means that in a three-player game you put a green castle tile on it in phases A, C and E. And in phases B and D you put a grey (or silver) mine tile on it.

[rule-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1708617/rule-question)

> If I install both the "ship & get two silverling" and the "ship & get an extra worker and your silverling" knowledge tiles, and at a later turn I take a shipping action. Would I get 2 silverling and a worker or would I need to choose which knowledge tile to resolve? Are both triggered or only one?

Both knowledge tiles "pay off" on that turn, so you would get 2 coins and a worker.

> Does the +/- 1 only apply when you place a new castle, mine, and knowledge in your estate? Or does placing a tile in your staging area apply as well?

Only placing it in your estate. There's a separate knowledge tile that adjusts your dice for placing a tile in your staging area.

> The rules state " draw 2 to 8 tiles, depending on player number"...but the numbers on the board are 4x 2's, 2x 3's, and 2x 4's. So it doesnt make much sense to me. Anyone know?

If there are two players, you fill the spaces marked "2". If there are 3 players you fill the spaces marked "2" & "3". If there are 4 players, you fill them all.

[city-hall](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2249433/city-hall)

> You can add another tile to he board. Does that mean anywhere? Or does it have to be touching?

Yes, it still has to touch. Putting the new tile on the board still has to follow all the rules of placing a tile. You don't have to use one of your die rolls to place a tile.

> I can't figure out the significance of the dice number shown on each goods tile. Can someone let me know what it means?

The number on the tile shows what number die you need to use in order to sell that good.

> There is also a second symbol in each goods depot that shows a dice and a goods tile. What does it mean?

The one on the goods depot, if you're referring to the white die followed by a :+ goods tile means that you roll the white die and place the new goods tile for this round on that number depot.

> If I've scored a three region (city) and collected the bonus of 6. Later in the game I fill in a five region, do I score it as 5 or 8 regions?

A region is only scored once when it's completed. it doesn't matter when you complete a region if you had previously completed a different region of the same type

[a-question-about-buying-black-tiles-with-silvering](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1039000/a-question-about-buying-black-tiles-with-silvering)

> A question on buying black tiles with silvering that I get on the same turn?
> For instance, at the beginning of my turn, let's pretend I got only 1 silvering originally.
> During my turn, I had sold my commidity and received 1 silvering, so that I got 2 silverings now.
> Can I buy any one of black tile with my 2 silvering then?

You can buy a black market tile before you use your dice or after you use your dice, if you have the money at that time.
The only timing restriction is that if you have a tile that gives you an additional action, like City Hall, you cannot buy a tile during the time between placing City Hall and taking the free placement action. So if you want to place a black market tile with City Hall you must buy it prior to putting City Hall on the board. A question that comes up a lot is when someone has three tiles in their storage area and they want to place City Hall then buy a new tile and use City Hall to place the new tile. That is not legal.

[yellow-number-12-rules-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1783779/yellow-number-12-rules-question)

> Does the yellow number 12 rule apply to ANY tile taken from the main board?

The English rulebook says, "The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust any die results being
used to take new six-sided tiles from the game board by +/- 1, just as if he had
used a worker tile for them."
