## The Unique Building Game About Pastures, Goods And Dice

## Game Idea

t he Loire Valley during the 15th Century. As influential princes, the

players devote their efforts to careful trading and building in order to lead their estates to prominence.

Two dice set out the action options, but the players always make the final choices. Whether trading or livestock farming, city building or scientific research, many different paths lead to the prosperity and prominence of the players!

The many ways to gain victory points in this building game require careful thought round after round along with extensive planning ahead. Thanks to the different estates, the game remains challenging for the players for a long time, as no two games play out alike.

The winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the game.

Ga m e I de ah

Players take on the roles of 15th Century princes in Burgundy

Over the course of 5 phases of play, players collect the game-deciding victory points via trading, livestock farming, city building or scientific research

The player with the most victory points at the end is the winner

## Game Components

164 six-sided tiles: _ 7x 8 buildings (beige, 16x with black backs) _ 7x 4 animals (light green, 8x with black backs) _ 26x "knowledge" (yellow, 6x with black backs) _ 16 castles (dark green, 2x with black backs) _ 12 mines (grey, 2x with black backs) _ 26 ships (blue, 6x with black backs) 42 goods tiles (square, 7 in each of 6 colours) 20 "Silverlings" (eight-sided) 30 worker tiles (square) 12 bonus tiles (square, 1 small and 1 large in each of 6 colours) 4 victory point tiles (with 100 / 200 points in each of the 4 player colours)

## 8 Playing Pieces (2 In Each Of The 4 Player Colours)

9 dice (2 in each of the 4 player colours plus 1 white one)

## 1 Game Board

6 player boards (double-sided, 4x No. 1, 1 each of Nos. 2-9)

If you are reading these rules for the first time, then we recommend ignoring the bold text in the right-hand column of each page. These texts form a summary of the rules to assist in quickly re-learning the game, even after not having played for a longer time.

## Game Setup

(Before playing for the first time, carefully punch all the tiles out of the counter sheets.)

Place the Gameboard in the middle of the table. It shows:

## 5 Phase Spaces (A-E)

## 5 Round Spaces

6 numbered depots (1-6) each with four spaces for six-sided tiles and 1 large goods space

## 1 Central Black Depot

## 12 Spaces For The Bonus Tiles

## 1 Turn Order Track

## 1 Victory Point Track (0-100)

Place the 20 Silverlings, the 30 worker tiles as well as the white die next to the game board.

Sort the 164 six-sided tiles according to the colour of their backs and place them, as separate face-down supplies, next to the game board.

Shuffle the 42 goods tiles (square tiles) face down. Then separate them into 5 face-down piles, each made up of 5 tiles. Place one pile onto each of the 5 phase spaces lettered A through E on the game board. The remaining 17 tiles remain in a face-down supply for now.

Place the 12 bonus tiles (square) onto the corresponding spaces on the game board.

Give each player: - 1 player board, placed with the Number 1 side face up in front of himself (for boards with the numbers 2 through 9, see the additional information on page 12);

1 castle (= dark green six-sided tile), to be placed face up onto the dark green middle space (with the die value 6) of his player board;

3 random goods tiles from the remaining 17 tiles, to be placed face up onto the three goods storage spaces in the upper left hand corner of his board: tiles of the same goods type (= colour) are stored together, different types are stored separately; (any remaining goods tiles are not used in the game and are returned to the box)

- the 2 dice in his colour;

1 playing piece in the same colour, to be placed onto the 0/100 space of the victory point track;

1 Silverling, to be placed in the appropriate storage space in the upper left hand corner of his board, visible to all other players;

1 victory point tile (with 100 / 200), to be placed next to his board for now.

Ga m e Se t u p Place the 20 Silverlings, the 30 worker tiles, the 164 six-sided tiles (sorted according to colour) and the white die next to the game board

## Place 5 Piles Of 5 Face-Down Goods Tiles Onto Phase Spaces A-E

Place 2 x 6 bonus tiles onto the corresponding spaces on the game board

Give each player:

1 player board

1 "start castle"

3 random goods tiles

2 same-coloured dice

1 playing piece (victory points)

1 playing piece (turn order)

1 victory point tile

1 Silverling

H  h 

Determine a start player by rolling dice. That player receives one worker tile which he places onto the appropriate storage space in the lower left hand corner of his board, visible to all other players. The next player in clockwise direction receives 2 worker chips, the third player receives 3 and the fourth player receives 4. Each player uses their second playing piece to mark the just-determined playing order on the first space of the turn order track: The start player's piece should be on top in the tower and the last player's piece should be at the bottom. Give the start player the white die.

Determine a start player and give each player 1 to 4 worker tiles depending on play order

The estate, with a total of 37 spaces split into regions of various different colours (such as pastures (light green), rivers (blue), cities (beige), etc.)

The game lasts for five phases (A through E). Each phase consists of five rounds.

## Gameplay Setup For Each Phase

At the start of each phase, the following setup is carried out: - Remove all six-sided tiles remaining on the board and return them to the box (naturally not required before the first phase). (Note: Ship, mine and castle tiles can be left in place as they are all the same! Any remaining goods tiles are also left on the board!)

- Randomly draw new six-sided tiles and place them, face-up, onto the matching-coloured six-sided spaces in the six numbered depots: In a 2-player game only those spaces marked with 2s (12 spaces), in a 3-player game only those spaces marked with 2s and 3s (18 spaces), and in a 4-player game all 24 spaces will have tiles placed onto them. Note: In the three-player game only, there is an exception for the dark green space in the No. 6 depot: In phases A, C and E a castle is placed onto it as normal, but in phases B and D a mine (grey) is placed there instead! Don't forget

The estate's number (Estate 1 is in the game 4 times, 2 to 9 once each)

## Ga M E Pl Ay

## At The Start Of Each Phase:

- all remaining six-sided tiles are removed (not in the first phase)

- Goods tiles on the depots' goods spaces remain

- add new face-up six-sided tiles from the supply (depending on number of players)

- place 5 new goods tiles, face-up, onto the round spaces

H  h

H  h 

- Randomly draw black-backed six-sided tiles and place them, face-up, onto the black depot in the middle of the game board (draw 2 to 8 tiles, depending on player number).

- Take the 5 goods tiles for the current phase and place them, face-up, onto the five square round spaces below the phase spaces.

## The Fi Ve Game R Ounds

After phase setup, five game rounds follow, each of which is carried out in the same manner:

First, all players roll their two dice, with the start player also rolling the white die. Then all players place their dice in front of themselves so that all players can see them. Note: Rolling simultaneously allows those players whose turns come later to start planning their turns ahead of time.

The start player starts. First, he takes the topmost goods tile from the round spaces and places it onto the goods space of the depot whose number matches the number rolled on the white die. With this, the white die's function for this turn is complete; it cannot be used by the start player to assist him on his own turn (and can never be adjusted via worker tiles!). Thereafter, the start player carries his turn out. It is then the turn of the next player in turn order (moving from right to left on the turn order track and from top to bottom in a given tower). Once each player has had a turn, a new round begins, etc. As 5 goods tiles are added each phase and since one tile is added to a depot at the start of each round, it is easy to tell which round the cur- rent one is and how long the current phase (and by extension the entire game) will last.

Th e f i v e rou n ds

## All Roll Simultaneously

Start player places goods tile according to white die result

## A Player'S Turn

â€¦ consists of carrying out exactly two actions, one per die. Once a die has been used, it is placed onto the used die storage space in the upper right hand corner of the player's board.

Worker tiles: These may be used at any time (a tile, once used, is returned to the general supply) to adjust a die's result up or down by 1. Changing a die's result from 1 to 6 or from 6 to 1 is also permitted and also costs one worker tile. Players may use multiple tiles to change a die's result multiple times.

Example: By paying 2 worker tiles, Anna can turn a 2 into a 6 and subsequently take a six-sided tile from the No. 6 depot.

Starting with the start player and then continuing in turn order, each player uses their dice to carry out two actions

Each worker tile used can adjust a die's result by +/- 1 (including from 1 to 6 or vice versa)

H  h

## The Act Ions

A die is required for each action. The two actions per turn may be carried out in any combination and order (including carrying the same action out twice).

## ïƒœâ€‰Action "Take Six-Sided Tile From The Game Board"

The player may take one six-sided tile of their choice from the depot whose number corresponds to the result of the die used to carry out

the action. The chosen tile is placed onto an empty storage space in the bot- tom left-hand corner of his board (never directly into his estate!). Should all of the storage spaces be full, then he must first choose a prior tile to discard (thus removing it from the game) and subsequently place the new tile onto the newly- emptied space (players should try to minimize how often they have to discard tiles).

## ïƒœâ€‰Action "Add Six-Sided Tile To Your Estate"

The player may take one six-sided tile of his choice from the stor- age area in the lower left-hand corner of his board and add it to his estate. The die chosen to carry out this action indicates which corresponding empty space he may place the tile onto. All newly-placed tiles must always lie directly adjacent to at least one previously-placed tile. A tile's colour must always match the colour of the space it is being placed onto. The first tile can thus only ever be placed onto one of the six spaces surrounding the 'start castle'.

Depending on what type of tile was placed, the following occurs immediately afterwards:

"Knowledge" (yellow): There are 26 different yellow tiles whose functions are described in more detail on pages 10 and 11.

Ship (blue): Whenever a player adds a ship tile to his estate (which can occur up to 6 times), then two things happen immediately:

1. The player takes all of the goods tiles on any one depot's goods space and adds them to the goods storage in the upper left hand corner of his board. Important: the chosen depot is completely separate and independent of the die result that was used to place the ship!

Each player may collect up to three different types of goods (= colours) in his goods storage. Tiles of the same colour are always piled on top of each other, dif- ferent coloured tiles are placed next to each other. If, because of this restriction, a player cannot store all of the goods tiles present in the chosen depot, then he simply leaves behind any goods he cannot store.

Example: Carla has added a ship to her estate and subsequently takes goods tiles from the goods space shown: the turquoise one (which she adds to her other turquoise good) as well as another one (pink or brown) which she will add to her still-empty goods storage space

2. The player moves his playing piece on the turn order track one space to the right. Should this space be occupied, then he places his piece on top of the other pieces. Should this result in him being start player for the next round then he also receives the white die.

ïƒœâ€‰Take six-sided tile from the game board

Die indicates which depot to take from; place the tile onto an empty storage space in the bottom left hand corner of the board

## ïƒœâ€‰Add Six-Sided Tile To Your Estate

Die indicates which empty space to place the tile onto; tile must be adjacent to previously-placed tile(s) and match the space's colour

## "Knowledge" (Yellow):

see pages 10 + 11

## Ships (Blue):

1.) Player takes all goods tiles from the depot of his choice and adds them to his goods storage

2.) Player moves one space to the right on the turn order track

H  h

H  h 

Animal (= a region of connected light green spaces): Whenever a player adds an animal tile to his estate (which can occur up to 6 times), then he immedi- ately receives victory points (and moves his playing piece on the victory point track forward). Each tile has between 2 and 4 animals on it and the player receives the corresponding number of victory points for them. Should the player already have animals of the same type in the pasture (= a region of connected light green spaces) that the new tile is being added to, then he scores all tiles with the same animal type again in addition to the newly- placed tile (see example below).

Important: The animal tiles must be part of the same pasture but do not need to be immediately adjacent to the newly-placed animal tile. Tiles with the same animal on them on other pastures are not scored.

## Animals (Lt. Green):

Provide victory points depending on how many animals are shown on the tile

When an existing pasture is expan- ded, then pre-existing animals are scored again

Example: Benno adds the topmost 4-cow tile to his estate. He receives 4 + 3 = 7 victory points for it. Should he add another 4-cow tile to this pasture later on, then he would receive 4 + 4 + 3 = 11 victory points for it.

Castle (dark green): Whenever a player adds a castle tile to his estate (which can occur up to 3 times), then he immediately carries out an additional action of his choice as if he had an extra die with any result he wishes at his disposal. He could, for example, immediately add another six-sided tile to his estate, or ...

## Castles (Dk. Green):

## Allow An Immediate Additional Action

Mine (grey): These tiles are (with the exception of a few of the yellow tiles) the only ones without an immediate effect when they are placed (which can occur up to 3 times). Instead, at the end of each phase, the player receives 1 Silverling from the supply for each mine in his estate.

## Mines (Grey):

Provide 1 Silverling income each at the end of each phase

Building (beige): Whenever a player adds a building tile to his estate (which can occur up to 12 times), then he immediately gets to make a single use of that building's advantage.

Important: Each of the 8 build- ing types may only occur once per city (= a region of connected beige spaces). Depending on the estate, there may be between 2 and 6 cit- ies of different sizes (1 to 8 spaces). Estate No. 1, for example, has 4 cities: one 1-size, one 5-size and two 3-size.

Each building provides an advantage immediately after having been built. These are also shown symbolically at left on the player boards.

## Buildings (Beige):

have various uses depending on building type

Don't forget

## No Identical Buildings In A City!

H  h 

## The Buildings

Warehouse When a player adds a warehouse to his estate, he may immediately (without having to use a die!) sell one goods type of his choice out of his goods storage, exactly as if he had chosen the 'Sell goods' action (see page 9).

## Warehouse

Player sells the goods type of his choice

Carpenter's Workshop When a player adds a carpenter's workshop to his estate, he may immediately take one beige-coloured building tile of his choice from any numbered depot (not from the black depot!) and place it onto an empty storage space in the bot- tom left-hand corner of his board.

## Carpenter'S Workshop

Player takes the building tile of his choice from the game board

Church When a player adds a church to his estate, he may immediately take one mine (grey), "knowledge" (yellow) or castle (dark green) tile of his choice from any numbered depot (not from the black depot!) and place it onto an empty storage space in the bottom left-hand corner of his board.

## Church

Player takes the mine, "knowledge" or castle tile of his choice from the game board

Market When a player adds a market to his estate, he may immediately take one ship (blue) or animal (light green) tile of his choice from any numbered depot (not from the black depot!) and place it onto an empty storage space in the bottom left-hand corner of his board.

## Market

Player takes the animal or ship tile of his choice from the game board

Boarding house When a player adds a boarding house to his estate, he immediately takes 4 worker tiles from the general supply and adds them to his own.

## Boarding House

Player takes 4 worker tiles

Bank When a player adds a bank to his estate, he immediately takes 2 Silverlings from the general supply and adds them to his own.

## Bank

Player takes 2 Silver- lings

City hall When a player adds a city hall to his estate, he may immediately add a second six-sided tile of his choice to his estate from one of his three storage spaces, regardless of colour (and including all of its effects!).

## City Hall

Player adds an additio- nal six-sided tile of his choice to his estate

Watchtower When a player adds a watchtower to his estate, he immediately moves his play- ing piece on the victory point track forward by 4 spaces.

## Watchtower

Player receives 4 victory points

H  h

H  h 

## Fundamentally, When Placing All Buildings:

- Their additional advantages are 'activated' via their placement, a die result (= action) is not required!

- Should a player not be able to make use of a building's advantage (because, for example, there aren't any more blue or light green tiles left in the numbered depots after having placed a market), then the building may still be added (although the advantage is lost in this case).

- The supply of worker tiles and Silverlings is not intended to be limited. In the rare case that the supply is exhausted, please substitute other materials.

Building advantages never need a die result for activation

Additional rules for placing six-sided tiles:

- Whenever a player takes a six-sided tile from the game board, he must always first place it onto a storage space in the lower left-hand corner of his board. This is still the case even if he uses his second action to immediately add it to his estate.

- Six-sided tiles, once added to an estate, may never be moved or removed.

- As soon as a coloured region â€“ regardless of its size â€“ is completely covered with tiles, then this region is considered to be complete and scores victory points in two different ways: 1. Depending on its size (1 to 8 spaces), the completed region scores between 1 and 36 victory points which are immediately scored on the victory point track.

2. Additionally, the region â€“ depending on the phase â€“ scores between 10 and 2 victory points: The empty phase space (A-E, in the upper right of the game board) for the current phase indicates how many additional victory points each completed region (regardless of its size!) is worth: between 10 in the first phase (A) and 2 in the last phase (E).

- The first player who manages to cover all spaces of one colour in his entire estate with tiles (by placing his third mine, for example, or his sixth animal tile) immediately takes the corresponding large bonus tile from the game board. He immediately scores victory points depending on the number of players (5 victory points with 2 players, 6 victory points with 3 players or 7 victory points with 4 players).

The second player to finish covering up this same colour takes the small bonus tile and the correspond- ing 2 to 4 victory points. Third and fourth place receive nothing.

Note: As soon as a player reaches or exceeds 100 victory points on the victory point track, then he places his victory point tile onto his board with the 100 side up. The tile should be placed in the upper right hand corner, next to the used die storage. When a player reaches 200 vic- tory points, then he flips his tile over

Never add tiles directly to an estate from the game board

Tiles added to an estate remain there until the end of the game

As soon as a district is completely covered with tiles, it scores victory points in two different ways:

1.) Depending on its size (1-8 spaces): 1-36 victory points

2.) Depending on the phase (A-E): 10-2 victory points

The first player to cover up all spaces of one colour in his estate receives the corresponding large bonus tile and its associated victory points (2-4 players: 5-7 VP)

The second player to accomplish this receives the small bonus tile and its associated victory points (2-4 players: 2-4 VP)

H  h 

## Action "Sell Goods"

A player may choose to sell all goods of one type from his goods storage. The die chosen to carry out this action indicates which goods type (= colour) may be sold. All corresponding goods tiles in the player's goods storage are piled, face-down, onto the goods storage space on the player's board intended for this purpose. For doing this, the player receives: - exactly one Silverling from the supply, regardless of how many tiles he just sold (= turned face-down), as well as - 2, 3 or 4 victory points per tile (depending on the number of players). Note: A player must always sell all tiles of a type when choosing the "Sell Goods" action, even if he would like to keep some in reserve.

## Sell Goods

Die result indicates goods type: all goods of this type must be sold (= turned over):

- + 1 Silverling per sale

- + 2-4 VP per tile (with 2-4 players)

Action "Take worker tiles"

Finally, a player may choose to use any die result to take 2 worker tiles from the general supply. In this case, the die result itself is

## Meaningless.

## Take Worker Tiles

regardless of die result, the player takes 2 worker tiles from the general supply

## The Central Black Depot

In addition to his two dice actions, each player may, once per turn, choose to buy one of the six-sided tiles from the central black depot. He may do this at any point during his turn: before, between or after the dice actions.

To accomplish this, the player must return 2 Silverlings to the general supply and subsequently place the newly-purchased six-sided tile, as with any tile from the game board, onto an empty storage space in the lower left-hand corner of his board.

Once per turn, each player may pay 2 Silverlings to buy one tile of their choice from the black depot

## End Of A Phase

A phase ends after five rounds. Players with mines now receive the correspond- ing number of Silverlings. Some of the yellow "knowledge" tiles may also have an effect. The next phase then begins.

A phase ends after 5 rounds: All players with mines receive new Silverlings (and note any "know- ledge" tiles!)

## Game End

The game ends after the fifth phase has been played through to completion. Final scoring follows, during which players receive victory points for the following:

- each unsold goods tile: 1 victory point - each remaining Silverling: 1 victory point - every two worker tiles: 1 victory point - each VP-bearing yellow tile (see pages 10 and 11). (Note: Six-sided tiles remaining on the storage spaces of a player's board are not scored!)

The player who is the farthest along on the victory point track is the winner. In the case of a tie, the winning player is the tied player with the fewest empty estate spaces. Should there still be a tie, then the winning player is the tied player who went later in turn order.

## Game End

The game ends at the end of the 5th phase (= 25 rounds/ 50 dice actions)

The following are scored: â€¢ remaining goods tiles: 1 VP â€¢ per Silverling: 1 VP â€¢ per 2 worker tiles: 1 VP â€¢ yellow tiles: X VP

The player with the most victory points is the winner

H  h

H  h 

The yellow tiles ("Knowledge") The game includes 26 different yellow tiles. Many have effects that take place immediately after placement, in that they change certain rules. Others only come into play during final scoring.

## The Yellow Tiles

1) The player who adds this tile to his estate may ignore the rule that only one building of each type is allowed in each city. He may thus add as many build- ings as he likes, without restriction, to his cities.

2) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the general supply in addition to the usual Silverling for each of his mines at the end of each phase.

3) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 Silverlings from the general supply instead of 1 each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate).

4) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the general supply in addition to the usual Silverling each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate).

5) The player who adds this tile to his estate may, when adding a ship to his estate, choose to take goods tiles not from one but from two neighbouring goods spaces and add them to his goods storage.

6) The player who adds this tile to his estate may buy not only from the central black depot but also from the other six depots (i.e. from all seven). That player may still only make one purchase per turn.

7) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 1 victory point more for each animal tile (i.e. not for each individual animal!) that scores points when a new animal tile is added. Example: Benno adds a 3 sheep tile to a pasture that already has a 4 sheep tile. He scores (3+1) + (4+1) = 9 victory points. Should he later add a 2 pig tile to this pasture, then it would score 3 victory points.

8) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust a die result by up to +/- 2 per worker tile that he pays. Example: To make a 3 out of a 6, Carla would now only need 2 worker tiles.

9) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust all die results being used to place buildings (beige tiles) by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.

10) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust all die results being used to place ships or animals (blue or light green tiles) by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.

H  h 

11) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust all die results being used to place castles, mines or "knowledge" (dark green, grey or yellow tiles) by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.

12) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust any die results being used to take new six-sided tiles from the game board by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.

13) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one Silverling in addi- tion to the usual 2 worker tiles each time he chooses the "Take worker tiles" dice action. Note: This tile has no effect when adding a boarding house.

14) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 4 (instead of the usual 2) worker tiles each time he chooses the "Take worker tiles" dice action.

15) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 3 victory points at the end of the game for each goods type that he has sold at least one goods tile of. Unsold goods are ignored. Note: Players may look at their sold goods tiles at any time. Example: Dario has sold the following goods tiles: 4x red, 3x violet, 3x pink and 1x orange. He receives 4 types x 3 victory points = 12 VP.

16-23) The players who add these tiles (Nos. 16-23) to their estates receive 4 victory points at the end of the game for each corresponding building that has been added to their estates. Example: Benno has yellow tiles 17 (watchtowers) and 22 (banks) in his estate at the end of the game, along with 2 watchtowers and 4 banks. He receives

(2 x 4) + (4 x 4) = 24 victory points for them.

24) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 4 victory points at the end of the game for each animal type that has been added to his estate. Example: Anna has 1 cow, 1 chicken and 3 sheep tiles at the end of the game. She receives 3 types x 4 victory points = 12 VP.

25) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 1 victory point at the end of the game for each sold goods tile. Unsold goods are ignored. Should Dario have also owned this tile, then he would have received 11 VP for it (see example under tile 15 above).

26) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 victory points at the end of the game for each bonus tile he claimed, regardless whether they are large or small.

## Those Who Know The Game Well

â€¦ can make the following changes during Game Setup: After all typical game setup is complete and players have determined the player order, each player receives a random player board. Players are free to choose which side (front or back) of the board they wish to use, as well as which (dark green) space they will place their starting castle on. Players should agree ahead of time whether these decisions will be made openly (one after the other in turn order) or secretly (all players simultaneously).
