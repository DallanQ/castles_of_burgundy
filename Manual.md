## GAME IDEA

The Loire Valley during the 15th Century. As influential princes, the 
players devote their efforts to careful trading and building in order to 
lead their estates to prominence. 
Two dice set out the action options, but the players always make the final 
choices. Whether trading or livestock farming, city building or scientific 
research, many different paths lead to the prosperity and prominence of the 
players!

The many ways to gain victory points in this building game require careful 
thought round after round along with extensive planning ahead. Thanks to 
the different estates, the game remains challenging for the players for a long 
time, as no two games play out alike.

The winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the 
game.

### GAME IDEA

Players take on the roles of 15th 
Century princes in Burgundy
Over the course of 5 phases of play, 
players collect the game-deciding 
victory points via trading, livestock 
farming, city building or scientific 
research
The player with the most victory 
points at the end is the winner

## GAME COMPONENTS164 six-sided tiles: 
- 164 six-sided tiles:
    - 7x 8 buildings (beige, 16x with black backs)  
    - 7x 4 animals (light green, 8x with black backs) 
    - 26x “knowledge” (yellow, 6x with black backs)   
    - 16 castles (dark green, 2x with black backs)
    - 12 mines (grey, 2x with black backs)
    - 26 ships (blue, 6x with black backs)
- 42 goods tiles (square, 7 in each of 6 colours) 
- 20 “Silverlings” (eight-sided) 
- 30 worker tiles (square) 
- 12 bonus tiles (square, 1 small and 1 large in each of 6 colours)  
- 4 victory point tiles (with 100 / 200 points in each of the 4 player colours)
- 8 playing pieces (2 in each of the 4 player colours)
- 9 dice (2 in each of the 4 player colours plus 1 white one)
- 1 game board
- 6 player boards (double-sided, 4x No. 1, 1 each of Nos. 2-9

## Game Setup (page 2)

Place the **Gameboard** in the middle of the table. It shows:

- **5 phase spaces** (A-E)

- **5 round spaces**

- **6 numbered depots** (1-6) each with four spaces for six-sided tiles and 1 large goods space

- **1 central black depot**

- 12 spaces for the **bonus tiles**

- **1 turn order track**

- **1 victory point track** _(0-100)_


> The game board is divided into several key sections: five **phase spaces** labeled A to E to guide the flow of each game phase, five **round spaces** for tracking rounds, and six **numbered depots** (1 to 6), each containing four spaces for six-sided tiles and one large goods space. In the center is a **black depot**, which likely holds shared or special resources. There are twelve spaces dedicated to **bonus tiles**, a **turn order track** to manage player turns, and a **victory point track** ranging from 0 to 100 to keep score as players progress toward victory. This organized layout suggests a game focused on phases, resource management, and competitive scoring.


Place the **20 Silverlings** , the **30 worker tiles** as well as the **white die** next to the game board.

Sort the **164 six-sided tiles** according to the colour of their backs and place them, as separate _face-down_ supplies, next to the game board.

Shuffle the **42 goods tiles** (square tiles) face down. Then separate them into 5 face-down piles, each made up of **5 tiles**. Place one pile onto each of the 5 phase spaces lettered A through E on the game board. The remaining **17 tiles** remain in a face-down supply for now.

Place the **12 bonus tiles** (square) onto the corresponding spaces on the game board.

**Give each player:**

- **1 player board,** placed with the **Number 1** side face up in front of himself
_(for boards with the numbers 2 through 9, see the additional information on page 12)_ ;

- **1 castle** (= dark green six-sided tile), to be placed face up onto the dark green middle space (with the die value 6) of his player board;
  
- **3 random goods tiles** from the remaining 17 tiles, to be placed _face up_ onto the three goods storage spaces in the upper left hand corner of his board: tiles of the same goods type (= colour) are stored together, different types are stored separately;
_(any remaining goods tiles are not used in the game and are returned to the box)_

- **the 2 dice** in his colour;
  
- **1 playing piece** in the same colour, to be placed onto the 0/100 space of the victory point track;
  
- **1 Silverling** , to be placed in the appropriate storage space in the upper left hand corner of his board, visible to all other players;
  
- **1 victory point tile** (with 100 / 200), to be placed next to his board for now.

Determine a **start player** by rolling dice. That player receives one worker tile which he places onto the appropriate storage space in the lower left hand corner of his board, visible to all other players. The next player in clockwise direction receives 2 worker chips, the third player receives 3 and the fourth player receives 4.

Each player uses their second playing piece to mark the just-determined playing order on the first space of the turn order track: The start player’s piece should be on top in the tower and the last player’s piece should be at the bottom.

Give the start player the white die.

The game lasts for five phases (A through E). Each phase consists of five rounds.

## Gameplay (page 3)

#### Setup for each phase (page 3)

At the start of _each_ phase, the following setup is carried out:

- Remove all six-sided tiles remaining on the board and return them to the box (naturally not required before the first phase).
  _(Note: Ship, mine and castle tiles can be left in place as they are all the same! Any remaining goods tiles are also left on the board!)_
  
- Randomly draw new six-sided tiles and place them, face-up, onto the
matching-coloured six-sided spaces in the six numbered depots: In a
2-player game only those spaces marked with 2s (12 spaces), in a 3-player game only those spaces marked with 2s and 3s (18 spaces), and in a 4-player game all 24 spaces will have tiles placed onto them.
  _Note: In the three-player game only, there is an exception for the dark green space in the No. 6 depot: In phases A, C and E a castle is placed onto it as normal, but in phases B and D a mine (grey) is placed there instead!_

- Randomly draw black-backed six-sided tiles and place them, _face-up_ , onto the black depot in the middle of the game board (draw 2 to 8 tiles, depending on player number).
  
- Take the 5 goods tiles for the current phase and place them, _face-up_ , onto the five square round spaces below the phase spaces.

### The Five Game Rounds (page 4)

After phase setup, five game rounds follow, each of which is carried out in the same manner:

First, all players roll their two dice, with the start player also rolling the white die. Then all players place their dice in front of themselves so that all players can see them. 
_Note: Rolling simultaneously allows those players whose turns come later to start planning their turns ahead of time._

The start player starts. First, he takes the topmost goods tile from the round spaces and places it onto the goods space of the depot whose number matches the number rolled on the _white_ die.

With this, the white die's function for this turn is complete; it cannot be used by the start player to assist him on his own turn (and can never be adjusted via worker tiles!).

Thereafter, the start player carries his turn out. It is then the turn of the _next player in turn order_ (moving from right to left on the turn order track and from top to bottom in a given tower). Once each player has had a turn, a new round begins, etc.

As 5 goods tiles are added each phase and since one tile is added to a depot at the start of each round, it is easy to tell which round the current one is and how long the current phase (and by extension the entire game) will last.

### A Player's Turn (page 4)

… consists of carrying out exactly two actions, one per die. Once a die has been used, it is placed onto the used die storage space in the upper right hand corner of the player's board.

*Worker tiles:* These may be used at any time (a tile, once used, is returned to the general supply) to adjust a die's result up or down by 1. Changing a die's result from 1 to 6 or from 6 to 1 is also permitted and also costs one worker tile. Players may use multiple tiles to change a die's result multiple times.

_Example: By paying 2 worker tiles, Anna can turn a 2 into a 6 and subsequently take a six-sided tile from the No. 6 depot._

### The Actions (page 5)

A die is required for each action. The two actions per turn may be carried out in any combination and order (including carrying the same action out twice).

#### Action "Take six-sided tile from the game board" (page 5)
> an image containing 6 hexagons of different colors all alligned to the right with an arrow pointing downwards

The player may take _one six-sided_ tile of their choice from the depot whose number corresponds to the result of the die used to carry out
the action. The chosen tile is placed onto an _empty_ storage space in the bottom left-hand corner of his board (never directly into his estate!). Should all of the storage spaces be full, then he must first choose a prior tile to discard (thus removing it from the game) and subsequently place the new tile onto the newly- emptied space _(players should try to minimize how often they have to discard tiles)_.

#### Action "Add six-sided tile to your estate" (page 5)
> an image containing 6 hexagons of different colors all alligned to the left with an arrow pointing upwards 

The player may take one _six-sided_ tile of his choice from the storage area in the lower left-hand corner of his board and add it to his estate. The die chosen to carry out this action indicates which corresponding empty space he may place the tile onto. All newly-placed tiles must _always_ lie directly adjacent to at least one _previously-placed_ tile. A tile's colour must _always_ match the colour of the space it is being placed onto.
_The first tile can thus only ever be placed onto one of the six spaces surrounding the 'start castle'._

Depending on what type of tile was placed, the following occurs immediately afterwards:

#### Knowledge (yellow) (page 5)
There are 26 different yellow tiles whose functions are described in more detail on pages 10 and 11.

#### Ship (blue) (page 5)

Whenever a player adds a ship tile to his estate (which can occur up to 6 times), then two things happen _immediately_:

1. The player takes _all_ of the goods tiles on _any one_ depot's goods space and adds them to the goods storage in the upper left hand corner of his board.
 _Important: the chosen depot is completely separate and independent of the die result that was used to place the ship!_

Each player may collect up to _three_ different _types_ of goods (= colours) in his goods storage. Tiles of the same colour are always piled _on top of each other_, dif- ferent coloured tiles are placed next to each other. If, because of this restriction, a player cannot store all of the goods tiles present in the chosen depot, then he simply leaves behind any goods he cannot store.

_Example: Carla has added a ship to her estate and subsequently takes goods tiles from the goods space shown: the turquoise one (which she adds to her other turquoise good) as well as another one (pink or brown) which she will add to her still-empty goods storage space_

2. The player moves his playing piece on the turn order track _one_ space to the right. Should this space be occupied, then he places his piece _on top_ of the other pieces. Should this result in him being start player for the next round then he also receives the white die.

#### Animal (page 6)

(= a region of connected light green spaces): Whenever a player adds an animal tile to his estate (which can occur up to 6 times), then he immediately receives victory points (and moves his playing piece on the victory point track forward). Each tile has between 2 and 4 animals on it and the player receives the corresponding number of victory points for them.

Should the player already have animals of the _same_ type in the pasture (= a region of connected light green spaces) that the new tile is being added to, then he scores all tiles with the _same_ animal type _again_ in _addition_ to the newly-placed tile _(see example below)_.

_Important:_ The animal tiles must be part of the same pasture but do not need to be immediately adjacent to the newly-placed animal tile. Tiles with the same animal on them on _other_ pastures are not scored.

_Example: Benno adds the topmost 4-cow tile to his estate. He receives 4 + 3 = 7 victory points for it. Should he add another 4-cow tile to this pasture later on, then he would receive 4 + 4 + 3 = 11 victory points for it._

#### Castle (dark green) (page 6)

Whenever a player adds a castle tile to his estate (which can occur up to 3 times), then he _immediately_ carries out an additional action _of his choice_ as if he had an extra die with any result he wishes at his disposal. _He could, for example, immediately add another six-sided tile to his estate, or ..._

>Image of a rectangular shape illustratiing a medieval castle with towers and walls. Next to it, there is a gray die with a "+" symbol beside it, indicating that placing a castle allows an extra action.

#### Mine (grey) (page 6)

These tiles are (with the exception of a few of the yellow tiles) the only ones without an immediate effect when they are placed (which can occur up to 3 times). Instead, at the end of each phase, the player receives 1 Silverling from the supply for each mine in his estate.

> Image depiction of a mine with some rocks or hills, suggesting mineral extraction. Below it is a silver coin with a currency symbol on it, followed by the letters "A-E," likely representing game phases or rounds when income is collected.

#### Building (beige) (page 6)

Whenever a player adds a building tile to his estate (which can occur up to 12 times), then he _immediately_ gets to make a _single_ use of that building's advantage.

_Important_: Each of the 8 building _types_ may only occur _once_ per city (= a region of connected beige spaces). Depending on the estate, there may be between 2 and 6 cit- ies of different sizes (1 to 8 spaces).
_Estate No. 1, for example, has 4 cities: one 1-size, one 5-size and two 3-size._

Each building provides an advantage immediately after having been built. These are also shown symbolically at left on the player boards.

> Image illustrating two buildings, one resembling a factory or warehouse with large doors and a red roof. Below these buildings, there is a set of cards or tiles, each marked with different symbols, implying that buildings have diverse functions based on their type.


### The Buildings (page 7)

#### Warehouse (page 7) 

When a player adds a warehouse to his estate, he may immediately (without having to use a die!) sell one goods _type_ of his _choice_ out of his goods storage, exactly as if he had chosen the 'Sell goods' action (see page 9).

> Image illustrating a structure resembling a storage facility or warehouse, with an image of barrels or crates nearby, symbolizing goods ready for trade or sale

#### Carpenter's Workshop (page 7)

When a player adds a carpenter's workshop to his estate, he may immediately take _one beige-coloured_ building tile of his choice from any numbered depot _(not from the black depot!)_ and place it onto an empty storage space in the bot- tom left-hand corner of his board.

>  Image illustrate a building with wooden structures and tools, suggesting construction or manufacturing. A small image of a yellow tile beside it represents the action of choosing a building tile.

#### Church (page 7) 

When a player adds a church to his estate, he may immediately take _one_ mine (grey), "knowledge" (yellow) or castle (dark green) tile of his choice from any numbered depot _(not from the black depot!)_ and place it onto an empty storage space in the bottom left-hand corner of his board.

> Image illustrating a church building with a steeple, along with small icons of a mine, book, and animals below it, indicating the choices available to the player.
#### Market (page 7)

When a player adds a market to his estate, he may immediately take _one_ ship (blue) _or_ animal (light green) tile of his choice from any numbered depot _(not from the black depot!)_ and place it onto an empty storage space in the bottom left-hand corner of his board.

> Image illustrating a marketplace with various goods, alongside icons of animals and a ship, representing the types of tiles that can be chosen. an image of numerous bungalows

#### Boarding House (page 7)

When a player adds a boarding house to his estate, he immediately takes 4 worker tiles from the general supply and adds them to his own.

> Image of a modest house with multiple doors or rooms, symbolizing a lodging or temporary residence, with four worker tiles depicted below, indicating a recruitment or workforce benefit.


#### Bank (page 7)

When a player adds a bank to his estate, he immediately takes 2 Silverlings from the general supply and adds them to his own.

> an image white 2 storybuilding with red zinc and silerlings are tiles with a silver-like shape at the top

#### City hall (page 7) 

When a player adds a city hall to his estate, he may immediately add a second six-sided tile of his _choice_ to his estate from one of his three storage spaces, regardless of colour (and including all of its effects!).

> Image  showing an official-looking building with a circular plaza, along with an icon of a player’s estate, emphasizing the ability to add a tile to the player's holdings.

#### Watchtower (page 7)

When a player adds a watchtower to his estate, he immediately moves his play- ing piece on the victory point track forward by 4 spaces.

> Image of a tall tower structure, often used for defense or surveillance, alongside an icon of a victory point medal, indicating the reward.

#### Fundamentally (page 8)

when placing _all_ buildings:

- Their additional advantages are 'activated' via their placement, a die result (= action) is not required!

- Should a player not be able to make use of a building's advantage _(because, for example, there aren't any more blue or light green tiles left in the numbered depots after having placed a market), then the building may still be added (although the advantage is lost in this case)._

- The supply of worker tiles and Silverlings is not intended to be limited. In the rare case that the supply is exhausted, please substitute other materials.

#### Additional rules for placing six-sided tiles: (page 8)

- Whenever a player takes a six-sided tile from the game board, he must _always_ first place it onto a storage space in the lower left-hand corner of his board. This is still the case even if he uses his second action to immediately add it to his estate.

- Six-sided tiles, once added to an estate, may never be moved or removed.

- As soon as a coloured region – regardless of its size – is _completely_ covered with tiles, then this region is considered to be complete and scores victory points in two different ways:

  1. Depending on its size (1 to 8 spaces), the completed region scores between 1 and 36 victory points which are immediately scored on the victory point track.

  > Image of a grid with two columns and eight rows, where the left column lists numbers 1 through 8, and the right column displays progressively higher point values (1, 2, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36) inside bronze-colored circles, likely indicating points awarded for reaching specific levels or objectives in the game.


  2. Additionally, the region – depending on the phase – scores between 10 and 2 victory points: The empty phase space (A-E, in the upper right of the game board) for the current phase indicates how many additional victory points each completed region (regardless of its size!) is worth: between 10 in the first phase (A) and 2 in the last phase (E).

  > Image illustrating five five labeled sections, "A" through "E," each containing a gray icon of a hand holding an object. Below each section is a golden circle with a point value, likely indicating rewards or costs. 

- The first player who manages to cover all spaces of one colour in his _entire estate_ with tiles _(by placing his third mine, for example, or his sixth animal tile)_ immediately takes the corresponding _large bonus tile_ from the game board. He immediately scores victory points depending on the number of players (5 victory points with 2 players, 6 victory points with 3 players or 7 victory points with 4 players).

The second player to finish covering up this same colour takes the _small bonus tile_ and the corresponding 2 to 4 victory points. Third and fourth place receive nothing.

Note: As soon as a player reaches or exceeds 100 victory points on the victory point track, then he places his victory point tile onto his board with the 100 side up. The tile should be placed in the upper right hand corner, next to the used die storage. When a player reaches 200 victory points, then he flips his tile over

> Image of four circular tokens, each featuring a central golden medallion with the number 100 in bold. The tokens have different colored backgrounds: red, green, black, and blue. Surrounding the central medallion on each token are faint decorative patterns, giving them a textured look.



#### Action "Sell goods" (page 9)

> Image of a small, shield-shaped tile with a stack of papers or cards at its center, and an upward-pointing arrow in the top-right corne


A player may choose to sell all goods of one type from his goods storage. The die chosen to carry out this action indicates which goods type (= colour) may be sold. All corresponding goods tiles in the player's goods storage are piled, face-down, onto the goods storage space on the player's board intended for this purpose. For doing this, the player receives: 

- exactly one Silverling from the supply, regardless of how many tiles he just sold (= turned face-down), as well as

- 2, 3 or 4 victory points per tile (depending on the number of players).
  
_Note: A player must always sell all tiles of a type when choosing the "Sell Goods" action, even if he would like to keep some in reserve._

#### Action "Take worker tiles" (page 9)

> an image of two worker tiles

Finally, a player may choose to use _any_ die result to take 2 worker tiles from the general supply. In this case, the die result itself is

#### The central black depot (page 9)

In _addition_ to his two dice actions, each player may, _once_ per turn, choose to _buy one_ of the six-sided tiles from the central black depot. He may do this at _any point_ during his turn: before, between or after the dice actions.

To accomplish this, the player must return 2 Silverlings to the general supply and subsequently place the newly-purchased six-sided tile, as with any tile from the game board, onto an empty storage space in the lower left-hand corner of his board.

#### End Of A Phase (page 9)

A phase ends after five rounds. Players with mines now receive the correspond- ing number of Silverlings. Some of the yellow "knowledge" tiles may also have an effect. The next phase then begins.

A phase ends after 5 rounds: All players with mines receive new Silverlings (and note any "know- ledge" tiles!)

## Game End (page 9)

The game ends after the fifth phase has been played through to completion. Final scoring follows, during which players receive victory points for the following:

- each unsold goods tile: 1 victory point

- each remaining Silverling: 1 victory point

- every two worker tiles: 1 victory point

- each VP-bearing yellow tile (see pages 10 and 11). 

  _(Note: Six-sided tiles remaining on the storage spaces of a player's board are not scored!)_

The player who is the farthest along on the victory point track is the winner. In the case of a tie, the winning player is the tied player with the fewest empty estate spaces. Should there still be a tie, then the winning player is the tied player who went later in turn order.

### The Yellow Tiles ("Knowledge") (page 10) 

The game includes 26 different yellow tiles. Many have effects that take place immediately after placement, in that they change certain rules. Others only come into play during final scoring.

1. The player who adds this tile to his estate may ignore the rule that only one building of each type is allowed in each city. He may thus add as many build- ings as he likes, _without restriction_, to his cities.

   > Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing two tile with the number 1

2. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the general supply in addition to the usual Silverling for each of his mines at the end of each phase.

   >Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing one worker tile, one silverling directly under the worker all to the right, and one goods tile to the left with the number 2 and the symbol A-E

3. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 Silverlings from the general supply instead of 1 each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate).

   >Image of  a yellow hexagon shape with a tile to the left, and two silverlings to the right, and the number 3

4. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the general supply in addition to the usual Silverling each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate).

   >Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing one worker tile, one silverling directly under the worker all to the right, and one goods tile to the left with the number 4

5. The player who adds this tile to his estate may, when adding a ship to his estate, choose to take goods tiles not from one but from two _neighbouring_ goods spaces and add them to his goods storage.

   >Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing one ship image to the left, and one goods tile to the right with the number 5

6. The player who adds this tile to his estate may buy not only from the central black depot but also from the _other_ six depots (i.e. from all seven). That player may still only make one purchase per turn.

   > Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing two silverlings tiles to the left, and four other tiles to the right with the number 6 at the bottom.

7. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 1 victory point more for each animal tile (i.e. not for each individual animal!) that scores points when a new animal tile is added.

   _Example: Benno adds a 3 sheep tile to a pasture that already has a 4 sheep tile. He scores (3+1) + (4+1) = 9 victory points. Should he later add a 2 pig tile to this pasture, then it would score 3 victory points._

   >image of a yellow hexagon shape containing three light green tiles stacked at the bottom of each other, followed by the number +1 alligned to the right, and the number 7 at the bottom.

8. The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust a die result by up to +/- 2 per worker tile that he pays.
  
    _Example: To make a 3 out of a 6, Carla would now only need 2 worker tiles._

   >Image of a yellow hexagon shape with the number -2 to the left, a worker tile in the center, the number +2 to the right, and the number 8 at the bottom.

9. The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust _all_ die results being used to place buildings (beige tiles) by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.

    > Image of a yellow heaxagon shape containing one tile with an arrow pointing NorthEast, with the numbers "+1" and "-1" to the right and the number 9 at the bottom.

12. The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust any die results being used to take new six-sided tiles from the game board by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.

    >image of a yellow hexagon shape containing four wheat colored tiles alligned to the left, with the numbers "+1" and "-1" alligned to the right, followed by the number 12 at the bottom.

13. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one Silverling in addi- tion to the usual 2 worker tiles each time he chooses the "Take worker tiles" dice action. 

    _Note: This tile has no effect when adding a boarding house._

    >Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing a six-faced dice to the left, two worker tiles and one silverling alligned to the right, with the number 12 at the bottom.

14. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives _4_ (instead of the usual 2) worker tiles each time he chooses the "Take worker tiles" dice action.

    >Image of a yellow hexagon shape containing a six-faced dice to the left, four worker tiles to the right all stacked to the bottom of each other, followed by the number 14 at the bottom.

15. The player who adds this tile to his estate receives _3_ victory points at the end of the game for each goods _type_ that he has _sold_ at least one goods tile of. Unsold goods are _ignored. Note: Players may look at their sold goods tiles at any time._
